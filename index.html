          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            Hi, my name is Michael. I am a programmer. I'm currently a junior
            at <a href="http://carthage.edu">Carthage College</a>, studying
            Computer Science.

          <h2>Some of My Projects</h2>
          
          <h3>Turbo Wookie - <a href="http://turbowookie.github.io/">turbowookie.github.io/</a></h3>
          <p>
            Turbo Wookie is a collaborative music jukebox. A group of people can start up a Turbo Wookie instance, share the address, then build and listen to a playlist together. Turbo Wookie is written in Go for the backend with Dart as the frontend. If you are wondering about the name, GitHub suggested it when we created the repository, and we took it.
          </p>

          <h3>Turbo Wookie Dart - <a href="https://github.com/mpeterson2/turbo-wookie">github.com/mpeterson2/turbo-wookie</a></h3>
          <p>
            I forked Turbo Wookie and rewrote it's backend in Dart. I was curious to know what writing Dart server side applications were like, and I didn't have any ideas, so I rewrote an existing project.
          </p>

          <h3>java-httpserver - <a href="http://dkuntz2.github.io/java-httpserver/">dkuntz2.github.io/java-httpserver/</a></h3>
          <p>
            java-httpserver is pretty much what it sounds like, a HTTP server written in java. Our goal was to create an easy to use API for Java developers trying to create a server with a RESTful API.
          </p>
          
          <h3>dart_mpd - <a href="https://github.com/mpeterson2/dart_mpd">github.com/mpeterson2/dart_mpd</a></h3>
          <p>
            dart_mpd is a library I wrote for Dart. It allows a developer to easily interact with an MPD instance. Instead of dealing with MPD's protocol yourself, you can let this library deal with it. dart_mpd is published on Dart's pub packages <a href="https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/mpd">here</a>
          </p>

          <h3>squatch-sighter - <a href="https://github.com/mpeterson2/squatch-sighter">github.com/mpeterson2/squatch-sighter</a></h3>
          <p>
            squatch-sighter is a map where anybody can report a Sasquatch sighting. That's about it. So if you see a Sasquatch, be sure to report it. It was written for a class assignment where we had to use Ruby Sinatra to build a slightly complex web app. The app is deployed on heroku - <a href="http://squatch-sighter.herokuapp.com/">squatch-sighter.herokuapp.com/</a> if you are interested in seeing it in action.
